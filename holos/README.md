# The Holos platform

This directory is the distro's Holos platform: CUE that renders every
component's Kubernetes manifests into `deploy/`, using Holos v1alpha6 as
released in holos v0.106.0. It is its own CUE module
(`go.holos.run/distro/holos`) beside the Go module at the repository root.

```

## Clusters

`clusters.cue` holds everything that differs between clusters: the site the
cluster runs in (its private DNS zone and resolvers), the Kubernetes networks
Talos configured, the node uplink, and the cluster's block of LoadBalancer
addresses. Components read their cluster as `Cluster`; none names a cluster
or an address. Every cluster in `clusters` gets every component in
`platform/platform.cue`'s registry, rendered to
`deploy/clusters/<cluster>/components/<component>/`, one file per resource.

The garage's ingress range is 10.20.0.30 to .49, sized for about six clusters
with three or four Gateway addresses each. `spike` has the first four,
10.20.0.30 to .33. A new cluster takes the next free block:

```cue
clusters: example: {
	site: sites.garage
	loadBalancer: {start: "10.20.0.34", stop: "10.20.0.37"}
}
```

## Components

| Component | What it renders |
| --- | --- |
| `cilium` | Cilium 1.20.4 from its Helm chart, in `kube-system`: CNI, kube-proxy replacement, LB IPAM and L2 announcements |
| `cilium-resources` | The cluster's `CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool`, a `CiliumL2AnnouncementPolicy` on `eth0`, and the `allow-ambient-hostprobes` `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` |
| `coredns` | CoreDNS from the CoreDNS project's Helm chart, replacing the one Talos deploys, with the site's private zone forwarded to its resolvers |

Helm charts are cached in `components/<name>/vendor/<version>/`, which is
committed, so a render needs no network and reads the same chart everywhere.

### Cilium

The values follow the Talos guide: Kubernetes IPAM from the node podCIDRs,
kube-proxy replacement reaching the API server through KubePrism on
`localhost:7445`, the agent and clean-state capability lists, and Talos's own
cgroup2 mount. The overlay is VXLAN, as ADR 0001 decided. For Istio ambient,
`cni.exclusive` is off, `socketLB.hostNamespaceOnly` is on and BPF
masquerading stays off.

Cilium 1.20's tested Kubernetes versions stop at 1.36; 1.37 is first tested
by 1.21, which is still a pre-release. 1.20.4, the latest stable release, runs
on 1.37 here; move to 1.21 once it is released.

Every Cilium pod, the agent and Envoy DaemonSets and the operator, has a
required node affinity `holos.run/pod-network NotIn [none]`, so nothing runs
on the control plane and it stays `NotReady` by design. Cilium registers no
admission webhook and no APIService.

Cilium is in `kube-system`, which Talos exempts from its baseline Pod
Security enforcement, so no namespace label is needed. The chart also creates
the `cilium-secrets` namespace, which holds only Secrets and RBAC.

Hubble's TLS certificates are made in the cluster by the chart's certgen Job
and CronJob (`hubble.tls.auto.method=cronJob`), not by `helm template`, which
would put a new private key in `deploy/` on every render.

### CoreDNS

Talos deploys CoreDNS itself, but its `KubeCoreDNSConfig` has only `enabled`
and `image`, and `talosctl upgrade-k8s` re-applies Talos's own Corefile and
prunes objects it no longer renders. The Corefile is platform policy, so the
platform owns CoreDNS: `providers/proxmox/talos/patches/controlplane.yaml`
sets `KubeCoreDNSConfig` `enabled: false`, and this component deploys CoreDNS
as the same `kube-dns` Service at `10.96.0.10`, the address every kubelet was
given. The chart's CoreDNS is 1.14.7, the version Talos 1.14.4 deploys.

The Corefile has two server blocks: `.` resolves cluster names and forwards
the rest to the node's resolver (Talos host DNS, which forwards to the LAN
resolver), and `bank.internal.` forwards straight to 192.168.2.1, so the
private zone does not depend on how the nodes' resolvers are set.

## Render

From this directory:

```sh
rm -rf deploy/clusters
holos render platform
git status deploy/
```

`holos render platform` writes files but never removes one a component no
longer renders, such as the Hubble certgen Job whose name changes with the
Cilium values, so remove `deploy/clusters` first. Commit the result;
`deploy/` must be clean after a render. Render one
component with `holos render platform --selector component=cilium`.

## Apply

Argo CD does not exist yet, so manifests are applied by hand with server-side
apply, in registry order, from this directory:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=~/.config/holos/talos/spike/kubeconfig
export TALOSCONFIG=~/.config/holos/talos/spike/talosconfig
d=deploy/clusters/spike/components

kubectl apply --server-side --field-manager=holos -f $d/cilium/
kubectl -n kube-system rollout status ds/cilium
kubectl -n kube-system rollout status deploy/cilium-operator

# The operator registers the Cilium CRDs when it starts.
kubectl wait --for=condition=Established crd/ciliumloadbalancerippools.cilium.io \
  crd/ciliuml2announcementpolicies.cilium.io crd/ciliumclusterwidenetworkpolicies.cilium.io
kubectl apply --server-side --field-manager=holos -f $d/cilium-resources/

kubectl apply --server-side --field-manager=holos -f $d/coredns/
kubectl -n kube-system rollout status deploy/coredns
```

The workers turn `Ready` once the Cilium agents are up; the control plane
stays `NotReady`.

### Taking CoreDNS over from Talos

A cluster created before `KubeCoreDNSConfig` was disabled still has Talos's
CoreDNS, recorded in Talos's manifest inventory
(`kube-system/talos-bootstrap-manifests-inventory`). Applying this component
over it fails on the Deployment's immutable selector, and a later
`talosctl upgrade-k8s` would prune the platform's objects of the same names:
it deletes any object in its inventory that carries no inventory annotation.
Switch over once, before applying the `coredns` component, from the
repository root:

```sh
# 1. Disable Talos's CoreDNS (the patch is already in controlplane.yaml).
set -a; . ~/.config/holos/proxmox.env; set +a
providers/proxmox/talos/cluster.sh gen spike
providers/proxmox/talos/cluster.sh apply spike

# 2. Remove Talos's objects and their inventory entries. This is what
#    `talosctl upgrade-k8s` would do, without touching the control plane.
kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment/coredns configmap/coredns \
  serviceaccount/coredns service/kube-dns
kubectl delete clusterrole/system:coredns clusterrolebinding/system:coredns
kubectl -n kube-system patch configmap talos-bootstrap-manifests-inventory --type=json -p '[
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/_system__coredns_rbac.authorization.k8s.io_ClusterRole"},
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/_system__coredns_rbac.authorization.k8s.io_ClusterRoleBinding"},
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/kube-system_coredns__ConfigMap"},
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/kube-system_coredns__ServiceAccount"},
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/kube-system_coredns_apps_Deployment"},
  {"op":"remove","path":"/data/kube-system_kube-dns__Service"}]'

# 3. Check that upgrade-k8s no longer touches CoreDNS.
talosctl upgrade-k8s --to 1.37.1 --dry-run 2>&1 | grep -iE 'coredns|kube-dns' || echo clean
```

Running `talosctl upgrade-k8s` for real in place of step 2 also works: it
prunes Talos's CoreDNS objects and their inventory entries itself, but it
also restarts the control plane components. A cluster created with the patch
in place never has Talos's CoreDNS and needs none of this.

## Check

```sh
kubectl get nodes
kubectl -n kube-system exec ds/cilium -c cilium-agent -- cilium-dbg status
kubectl get ciliumloadbalancerippools

kubectl create ns spike-test
kubectl -n spike-test run dnstest --image=docker.io/nicolaka/netshoot:v0.14 \
  --restart=Never --command -- sleep 3600
kubectl -n spike-test exec dnstest -- dig +search kubernetes.default A
kubectl -n spike-test exec dnstest -- dig @10.96.0.10 test.bank.internal A
kubectl -n spike-test create deployment echo \
  --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080
kubectl -n spike-test expose deployment echo --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080
kubectl -n spike-test get svc echo   # EXTERNAL-IP from 10.20.0.30-.33
curl http://<external-ip>/hostname   # from the garage network
kubectl delete ns spike-test
```

CoreDNS's metrics show which upstream answered: a `bank.internal` query is
counted against `to="192.168.2.1:53"`, anything else against host DNS,
`to="169.254.116.108:53"`:

```sh
kubectl -n spike-test exec dnstest -- curl -s http://<coredns pod IP>:9153/metrics |
  grep proxy_request_duration_seconds_count
```

LoadBalancer addresses answer TCP and UDP on the Service's ports only; they
do not answer ping.

On a fresh cluster, `cilium-dbg status` can report `Cluster health: 2/3`
for the first probe round, about two minutes: an agent probes a node's health
endpoint before that endpoint is up. Wait for the next round before reading
it as a fault.

## The control plane's mirror pods

Once the workers are `Ready`, the node lifecycle controller treats the
`NotReady` control plane as a failed node: it adds the
`node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoExecute` taint and, after the default
300-second toleration, evicts the mirror pods of kube-apiserver,
kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. The static pods keep running;
the kubelet recreates the mirror pods, so `kubectl get pods` shows them
`Terminating` and then young again, about every five minutes. While every
node was `NotReady` the controller held back, as it does for a full
disruption, which is why this starts only once Cilium is up.
